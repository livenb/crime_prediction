# Community evolution and Crime prediction

>'Don't go there, you will get shot!'

This is the word my friend told me at my first day in US. For all these years, I always concern about the safety when I visit a new area.  
In this project i get the open data of individual crime incidents from 5 cities: San Francisco, Los Angles, Detroit, Louisville and Philidephia. I will try to answer the following few questions:
1. How can i seperate the community one from another? How can i categorize them?
2. Over the years, how the crime situation changes in each of the community?
3. If I visit a area, can i predict what kind of crime would happen given the time and location?

Data are coming from [publicsafetydataportal.org](https://publicsafetydataportal.org/). The police department in different city use different termonology and category system,
